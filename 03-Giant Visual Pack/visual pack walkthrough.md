# Visual Pack 101

## Introduction
A visual pack allows the developer to teach GIANT how to render custom and unique visuals that are data driven.

## Setting Up
1. Download the sample visual pack from github [here](https://github.com/fx-giant/visual-pack-nodejs-sample).
> Note : you also may perform `git clone` to get the sample visual pack.

2. Unzip the sample visual pack. Then launch Visual Studio Code and open the folder you just downloaded.

    > If you see the error below![npm not install](./images/npm-not-installed.png) please install nodejs and retry.


5. After `npm install` is completed, run `npm run debug` and open **localhost:8080** in a new browser to see the sample visuals.

    > Debugging can be done here.

6. Follow the guide in [here](https://github.com/fx-giant/visual-pack-nodejs-sample) to upload the visual pack to GIANT. Run `npm run publish` to upload.

    > **Make sure to follow the steps in the [documentation](https://github.com/fx-giant/visual-pack-nodejs-sample) before running `npm run publish`.**
7. Go to GIANT, **My Dashboard(s)** => **Add** => **VIEW DASHBOARD** => **Add**. You should see the visual pack you uploaded in the list of charts.

## Creating Contact Chips

1. Go to `src/app.js` and replace the code with the below code. This is to generate the html of the chart, we will use d3 to render the chart. Refer [here](https://d3js.org/) for more information about d3. All the render logic will be done here.

2. Go to `src/app.scss` and replace all the code with the below code. You can add your own css if you wish to add more styling to the visual pack. Styling of the chart will be done here.

4. Go to `pubish/visual/quadrant-properties.js` and replace the code with the below code. This is to set the name of binded data and use it in `src/app.js`.

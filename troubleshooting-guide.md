**What to Do**   
This is caused by the way you chose to download the sample Notebook. Uploading a sample Notebook downloaded directly from the link will cause this issue.

Go to the resource main screen and download all the resources as a ZIP file. Then, unzip the file to get the sample resources. Try uploading the sample Notebook again. You will be able to do so successfully.
